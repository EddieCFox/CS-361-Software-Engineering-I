Vision statement documents

Most of the assignments in this class are inaccessible because I uploaded them to a server linked to an Oregon State University engineering account that was revoked a number of months after I graduated. My hard drive failed before I could back them up. Of particular importance, both group projects are inaccessible. 
While there is no code here, I included vision statements where I talk about a world problem and propose a way for software to help alleviate some aspects of it. This is mainly to serve as an example of software relating writing ability.
